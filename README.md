# What is this project
This is a template for future React applications which set up the necessary packages. Please note that this is a simulation of the <code>create-react-app</code> tool created for learning purposes. Use that if you prefer something more official and reliable.

Additionally, I also added <code>Eslint</code> into this setup.

# Usage
```bash
# Install the dependencies
npm install

# Init Eslint
./node_modules/.bin/eslint --init

# Build project
npm run build

# Live server
npm run start
```
